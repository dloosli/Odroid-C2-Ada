# Odroid C2 bare metal (Ada) - Script Folder

## Intro
This project subfolder contains some scripts that should support the development of bare metal applications in general.

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

## odroidc2baremetal.sh
All bare metal applications running on the Odroid C2 Single Board Computer need to be signed with the official software provided by hardkernel and AMLogic. This script tries to simplify this process by providing a setup, a signing and a flashing option. For details see the script header or run it with the option -h or --help.
