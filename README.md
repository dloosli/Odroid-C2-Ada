# Odroid C2 bare metal (Ada)

## Intro
This repository contains all the project files and findings for my bare metal programming project on the hardkernel Odroid C2 Single Board Computer. In the end, it should consist of some scripts to support the development with GPS (incl. signing bare metal applications), an (encreasing) driver library written in Ada and some documentation files about the development setup.

## References
A great repository to start with bare metal programming on the hardkernel Odroid C2 is the [ODROID-C2-bare-metal Repository by MrModd](https://github.com/MrModd/ODROID-C2-Bare-Metal).
&nbsp;
For Ada bare metal programming in general have a look at the [AdoCore Github repositories](https://github.com/AdaCore).
